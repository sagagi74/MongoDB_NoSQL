MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data

What this App does?

As a social media startup, we aim to develop an API for our social network utilizing a NoSQL database to efficiently manage large volumes of unstructured data. The API should start the server and sync Mongoose models to a MongoDB database upon invocation. It must support GET requests in Insomnia to retrieve user and thought data in formatted JSON, as well as POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to create, update, and delete users and thoughts. Additionally, it should handle POST and DELETE requests to manage reactions to thoughts and modify a user's friend list.
